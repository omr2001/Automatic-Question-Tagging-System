## üìò Project Overview

In Q&A platforms like Stack Overflow, accurate tagging is essential for content discoverability and efficient information retrieval. This project presents an **Automatic Question Tagging System** that leverages NLP techniques to classify and assign appropriate tags to a question based on its textual content.

## üöÄ Features

- Preprocessing of question text (tokenization, lemmatization, stop word removal)
- TF-IDF and Word Embedding-based feature extraction
- Multi-label classification using machine learning models
- Achieves up to **90% accuracy** on test data
- Scalable and efficient pipeline ready for real-time applications

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Languages**: Python  
- **Libraries**: `scikit-learn`, `NLTK`, `spaCy`, `Pandas`, `NumPy`  
- **Model**: Logistic Regression / SVM / Random Forest / Multi-label Classifier  
- **Vectorization**: TF-IDF / Word2Vec

## üìÇ Dataset

The dataset consists of user-submitted questions and their corresponding tags. Tags are typically multi-label, meaning each question may belong to multiple categories.

- **Format**: `.csv`
- **Columns**: `question_title`, `question_body`, `tags`

> *Dataset source: Kaggle / Custom-collected from Stack Overflow*
